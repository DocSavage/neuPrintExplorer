todo:

-architect queryform and support custom query -- fix static variable issue
-implement jquery for neo4j
-make result widget and connect with redux
-table to display results
-need server address add -- user name and password as well
-just pass plugins as props directly to Query and Query Form (but don't remove until other redux stuff is added)
-commit

-maybe stylize query to side pop-up menu and auto-expand if direct query and no results







-make shell for js stuff (table viewer, some redux state, selector widget, base class for forms, simple sample query form plugin)
    -Analyzer React (top-level page, contains query and results)
    -Results (results) React (for handling >=1 tables and click expand and pagination, export to CSV)
    -Table React (for individual table with pagination, export to CSV)
    -Query widget (parent widget for query list and query form)
    -QueryList (contains list of all queries/plugins) -- will cause form pop up
    -QueryForm (generic base class for handling queries, allow query to be downloaded, loading data that will be subscribed by top level that will spawn a results, show query made)
    -Specific Query Form (plugins) -- maybe eventually just a schema that is loaded at runtime so that new queries can be produced 
    -Custom query box
    -helper functions to help build form boxes
    -redux stuff to manage queries and query state

-make multi-table query that requires pagination (or lower pagination threshold artificially) -- test output table and pagination, multi table (click to expand), pagination for a lot of tables

-try to make plugin very simple and decoupled from the rest of the js (maybe allow creation from a schema?)

-modify ppt to explicitly list all denormalizations encoded

-add query string to URL and re-execute query (form fields and query type) -- top-level query should initialize to null or whatever is in the url; can parse tables and sorts as well

-add documentation and graph model picture to help documentation; provide graph picture for each query so people know what is going on -- probably use router

why unique (compared to connectomeexplorer and catmaid):

-ROIs are first class citizens -- ROIs are already known, should be in data model
-very simple graph model, more intuitive -- no sql junk and no special algebra
-emphasis on graph queries especially given approximate connectome stuff
-special handling of uncertainty
-simple interface for canned queries -- most analyses only use a couple widgets or things, don't need to over design
-emphasize getting data out and not visualization (except for maybe the top couple use cases)
-standalone, not tied to ecosystem
-data-lite -- should be easy to import, skeletons and synapses, etc
-schema-less but probably not as sophisticated as connectomeexplorer model, lot smpler
-allow for incremental update through interface that models proofreading actions
-neo4j is just easier


cool add-ons:

-neo4j can log queries and metadata can be associated -- that might be sufficient -- might be able to set permission for users to a particular function on the server

-show visual documentation for graph model

-record queries that people make; maybe keep stats and show distribution of query types made (don't show dev queries)

-allow some basic plotting/histogram options in addition to basic table and export?

-allow user to submit question on query they want to do -- basically for help (snack bar to show message sent?); allow user to submit a custom query for inclusion

-form to create and save a custom query -- dedicated server?




documentation and theory:

-add more information to PPT; clean up errors or changes; add property nodes?
-how to handle multi-tenancy -- just use labels and maybe auto-inject from webpage -- this will still slow down queries but maybe not so bad -- synapses and neurons are the only ones that probably need labels -- it is kinda like an ROI type
-denoralizations: skeleton is really just adding more info on neuron -- could be out of sync with neuron if not careful; synapse summary per ROI is duplicate of synapse set -- those can be out of sync if not careful

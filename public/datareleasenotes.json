      "Re-organizes cell types: increases the number of neurons with neuron type classification and provides more robust morphology and connectivity based groupings (note: some neurons are in different groups than in v1.0)",
      "Systematically applies 'final' names to neuron cell types.  There are no longer *_pct types; all cell types are ‘final’.  In some cases, we provide synonyms or other notes in the neuprint field called ‘notes’.",
      "Some QC was applied to various neuronal pathways, particularly those with low connection weights."
